					More and more people everyday are working from home. The workplace is no longer the office space. The
					situation we are facing today with COVID-19 suggests that this is possible and potentially, inevitable. But
					staying home doesn't mean we have to drop all of our good habits. We still need to workout, entertain
					ourselves, educate our children and maybe ask for help every now and then. But most importantly, we need to do
					all those things with people.
				</Typography>
				<Typography variant="body1" component="p">
					Homeo's purpose is to become the platform that people can come together and enjoy living at home. We hope that
					people will use the platform to book livestreaming classes. We want to ensure only high quality classes are
					delivered, thus, we want to collaborate with professional instructors that will teach yoga, pilates and other
					home workouts. Medical professionals that can hold Q&amp;A sessions to debug the myths around COVID-19.
					Professional nail artists that will provide tips on how to look your bestself whist at home. Storytellers that
					can entertain our children and many many more.

					How it works
				</Title>
				<Typography variant="body1" component="p">
					Easy! Just select one of our main categories and browse through a list of available classes. Ready for some
					yoga? Just book your session and we will send you an email half-hour before your class with a link to a "Zoom"
					meeting. Have your matt ready, your instructor and the rest of the class will join you!
